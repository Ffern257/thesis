##Abstract
This thesis examines the multifaceted interactions between humans and sea turtles, focusing on the role of online and social media in shaping public perceptions of sea turtle conservation. With sea turtle populations facing threats from habitat destruction, climate change, and bycatch, public awareness and engagement in conservation efforts are critical. This research employs social listening tools to analyze online discourse and sentiment related to sea turtle conservation across various digital platforms. Additionally, it introduces an interactive game designed to both assess and enhance public awareness regarding sea turtle conservation. By integrating data analytics from social listening with insights derived from game-based learning evaluations, this study aims to identify patterns in public engagement and knowledge gaps. The findings are expected to offer novel insights into effective conservation communication strategies, contributing to more informed and impactful conservation efforts. This thesis not only highlights the importance of digital media in environmental conservation but also explores the potential of gamification as a tool for environmental education and engagement.
